🚀 RESTful API with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL

This project demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. The application allows full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a PostgreSQL database, providing a solid foundation for building scalable and efficient backends.

🔧 Technologies Used

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

Express.js: Minimalist framework for building web servers.

PostgreSQL: Relational database management system.

Sequelize: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify database interactions.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secure authentication and authorization implementation.

📌 Features

Full CRUD: Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

JWT Authentication: Protect routes with token-based authentication.

Data Validation: Ensures data integrity and consistency.

Swagger Documentation: Interactive interface to test and explore the API.
